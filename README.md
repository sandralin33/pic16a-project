## Short Description
The goal of this project is to determine which features of an individual’s health data are highly predictive of whether the individual would get a stroke or not.

## Dataset
The dataset we used was “[Stroke Prediction Dataset”](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset?page=2) from kaggle.com. The dataset was created by [fedesoriano](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano) from kaggle.com, and the source of the data is confidential. The dataset allows its use only for educational purposes.
