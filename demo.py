# create demo file
# this file runs the functions

# THERE WILL BE ONE FILE FOR THE CUSTOM CLASS AND ONE FILE FOR CALLING AN INSTANCE AND RUNNING THE FUNCTIONS

# FOR CUSTOM CLASS - Sandra will try to inherit from an existing Python class that does Logistic Regression, and customize it to only include the methods that we need
# might need help lol
# FOR FUNCTIONS - "translate" your section to function(s)


# CUSTOM CLASS PORTION

# "TAKE INSPIRATION" FROM EXISTING LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL
# explain this
