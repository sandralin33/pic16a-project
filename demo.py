# create demo file??

# THERE WILL BE ONE FILE FOR THE CUSTOM CLASS AND ONE FILE FOR THE FUNCTIONS
# SEE PAGERANK.PY AND UTIL.PY FROM HOMEWORK 3 TO SEE HOW IT WORKS

# FOR CUSTOM CLASS - TWO OPTIONS (1) "TAKE INSPIRATION" FROM EXISTING LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL (2) CREATE METHODS THAT USE THE FUNCTIONS IN SOME WAY
# Sandra will figure out the custom class stuff (might need help tho lol)
# FOR FUNCTIONS - "translate" your section to function(s)

# CREATE A .IPYNB FILE TO CREATE AN INSTANCE OF THE CLASS AND RUN EVERYTHING
# for .ipynb file, format will be done in Jupyter Notebook and uploaded to github
